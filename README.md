> Seal payouts as FHE ciphertext. Every recipient decrypts only their own amount.

**Built for**: Zama Developer Program Mainnet Season 3 · Special Bounty × TokenOps

## What it does

Sotto lets you distribute tokens to any number of recipients in a single confidential transaction. Amounts are sealed as `euint64` FHE ciphertext on-chain — no block explorer, no node, no validator can read them. Only the recipient holding the matching private key can decrypt their own allocation.

### Two distribution modes

| Mode | SDK module | How it works |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Airdrop** | `@tokenops/sdk/fhe-airdrop` | Deploys a per-campaign clone contract. Recipients claim at their own pace using a ZK membership proof. Admin can revoke unclaimed tokens. |
| **Disperse** | `@tokenops/sdk/fhe-disperse` | Pushes sealed amounts directly to recipient wallets in one tx via the singleton contract. No claim step required. |

---

## TokenOps SDK usage

```ts
// Airdrop
import { createConfidentialAirdropClient } from "@tokenops/sdk/fhe-airdrop";

const client = createConfidentialAirdropClient({ publicClient, walletClient, address: airdropAddress });

await client.createAndFundConfidentialAirdrop({ token, recipients, amounts, startTime, endTime });
await client.claim({ encryptedInput, signature });
await client.isSignatureClaimed(recipient, handle);
await client.getClaimAmount({ encryptedInput, signature }); // generates ACL grant for decrypt
await client.withdraw(adminAddress);                         // revoke unclaimed tokens
```

```ts
// Disperse
import { createConfidentialDisperseClient } from "@tokenops/sdk/fhe-disperse";

const client = createConfidentialDisperseClient({ publicClient, walletClient });
await client.disperse({ token: wrapperAddress, recipients, amounts });
```

## Technical stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| FHE runtime | Zama Protocol — `tfhe-rs` via `@zama-fhe/sdk` + `@zama-fhe/react-sdk` |
| Encryption type | `euint64` — 64-bit unsigned integer sealed as ciphertext |
| Token standard | ERC-7984 — confidential ERC-20 extension |
| Token | `cUSDT` — official Zama mock USDT on Sepolia |
| ZK proofs | ZKPoK — input proofs that each sealed amount is well-formed without revealing it |
| Client-side decrypt | `useUserDecrypt` + `useConfidentialBalance` from `@zama-fhe/react-sdk` |
| Storage | Upstash Redis — campaign records, disperse index, webhook config |
| Frontend | Next.js 15, wagmi v2, RainbowKit, viem |

## How amounts stay private

1. Amounts are encrypted locally with `encryptUint64` before any network call — the plaintext never leaves the browser
2. A ZK input proof (ZKPoK) is generated alongside each ciphertext, proving the value is well-formed without revealing it
3. The sealed `euint64` is submitted in the distribution transaction — on Etherscan it appears as raw ciphertext bytes
4. Only the recipient can decrypt: `useUserDecrypt` requests a wallet signature proving key ownership, then the Zama gateway returns the plaintext entirely client-side

## User flows

### Create an airdrop (admin)
1. Connect wallet → **New distribution**
2. Enter a name and paste CSV: `0xAddress, amount` (one per line)
3. Choose **Airdrop**, set claim window open/close dates
4. Review step: pre-distribution balance guard prevents silent zero-transfers (ERC-7984 confidential transfers silently send 0 on insufficient balance — Sotto blocks this before broadcast)
5. Seal step — exactly **2 MetaMask interactions** regardless of recipient count:
   - `setOperator` (once per token, skipped if already set)
   - **Sign once** → derives an ephemeral browser session key via `keccak256(signature)`
   - Airdrop deployed with session key as `admin`
   - All N claim authorizations signed in-browser with the session key — zero further MetaMask popups
   - Session key is discarded from memory after sealing
6. Share the claim link: `cloakdrop.vercel.app/claim?id=<airdropAddress>`

### Create a disperse (admin)
1. Same flow but choose **Disperse**
2. Single tx via disperse singleton — sealed balances land in recipient wallets immediately

### Claim an allocation (recipient)
1. Go to `/claim` → connect wallet → see eligible sealed allocations
2. Select a distribution → **Declassify with my key**
3. `getClaimAmount` issues an ACL grant; `useUserDecrypt` decrypts the ciphertext in-browser — amount revealed with a scramble animation
4. **Claim to wallet** → `claim` tx moves the sealed amount into the recipient's confidential cUSDT balance

### Reveal confidential balance
The balance card on `/claim` uses `useConfidentialBalance` — reads the latest ciphertext handle and decrypts on demand, always reflecting the current on-chain balance after claims and disperses.

## Webhook integration

Configure a webhook URL in **Distributions → Settings**. Sotto fires a `POST` after every successful claim:

```json
{
  "event": "claim",
  "distribution": "0xAirdropAddress",
  "recipient": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "token": "cUSDT",
  "amount": "[FHE-sealed]",
  "ts": "2026-06-25T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Headers sent: `Content-Type: application/json`, `x-sotto-event: claim`

> `amount` is always `[FHE-sealed]` — Sotto never decodes ciphertext server-side.

## Testing end-to-end

1. **Get Sepolia ETH** from [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)
2. **Get test cUSDT**: click **Get 100,000 test cUSDT** on any distribution page — mints underlying ERC-20 and wraps to confidential cUSDT in one flow
3. **Test a disperse**: New distribution → paste 2–3 addresses → Disperse → Seal → check each recipient's `/claim` page
4. **Test an airdrop**: New distribution → Airdrop → Seal → open the claim link in a second wallet → Declassify → Claim
5. **Verify privacy**: open the deployment tx on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io) — all `amount` fields appear as hex ciphertext, never plaintext

## Session key signing

Standard browser-based airdrop dApps require one MetaMask signature per recipient (N popups for N recipients). Sotto solves this with deterministic session key derivation:

```ts
// 1. User signs one message → derive ephemeral private key
const sessionSig = await walletClient.signMessage({ message: `Sotto batch signing\nWallet: ${address}\nSalt: ${salt}` });
const sessionKey  = keccak256(toBytes(sessionSig));        // 32-byte private key
const sessionAcct = privateKeyToAccount(sessionKey);       // viem local account

// 2. Deploy airdrop with session account as admin
await factory.createAndFundConfidentialAirdrop({ params: { admin: sessionAcct.address, ... } });

// 3. Sign all N claim authorizations locally — no MetaMask
for (const r of recipients) {
  signature = await sessionAcct.signTypedData({ /* same EIP-712 as signClaimAuthorization */ });
}
// Key is discarded — never stored, never sent anywhere
```

Result: **2 MetaMask interactions total** (1 sign + 1 deploy tx) for any number of recipients. The salt is stored in the campaign record so the admin can re-derive the same key for revocation.

## Gas notes

- `setOperator` is sent once per (token, spender) pair — subsequent distributions skip it via an on-chain `isOperator` read, saving ~100k gas per run
- Airdrop creation deploys a factory clone (~300–500k gas) — one-time cost per campaign
- Disperse gas scales linearly with recipient count — each confidential transfer runs through the FHEVM coprocessor
- A pre-distribution balance guard checks confidential balance before sealing, preventing the ERC-7984 silent zero-transfer failure mode

---

## Security notes

- No backend signature check on the discovery API routes (`/api/campaigns`, `/api/claims`, `/api/disperse`, `/api/vestings`) — they're a convenience index for the UI, not a source of truth. All actual fund movement requires a real on-chain transaction with cryptographic verification (FHE ACL grants, EIP-712 signatures checked by the contract), so spoofed POST data can't move tokens — at worst it pollutes a wallet's activity list with entries that fail when interacted with.
- The webhook fetch validates against SSRF (rejects non-http(s) protocols and private/loopback IP ranges) before firing.
- No CSP header yet. React escapes all dynamic content by default and there's no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`/`eval` anywhere in the codebase, so there's no known injection vector for CSP to guard — but it's a reasonable hardening step for a follow-up, deferred here to avoid risking a misconfigured allowlist breaking WalletConnect or the Zama relayer connection right before submission.
